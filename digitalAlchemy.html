             This peice was conceived out of an exploration of digital processes mixing, converting, and reimaging, life and experiental data. Beginning with a recording i made of my father playing drums at our farmstead in Vermont, converting physical soundwaves to digital. Using <a class="bisquetext" href="https://derivative.ca/download">Touchdesigner</a> i then created a network that took the sound file, selectivly split the frequencies to isolate kick, toms, snare, and cymbols, and used those to progressivly generate particles forming a three-dimensional visual representation of the sound input. This is where i really started thinking about these processes as digital alchemy, questioning the reality of recording processes through the material shift of data from one form to another.
              <br><br>
                From here i wanted to bring the file back into the material world from the digital but because the data existed solely on the GPU i wasn't able to easily acsess it* so at a loss for how to get a printable 3d file i went through photogrametry. Taking hundreds of virtual photos of the final object from all around it these images where then used to recompile a final editable model. 
                This model was then printed and fixed with a WDMX RGB bulb that could connect back to my laptop and glow in unison to the original sound.

                *while i tried to find a way to output the position and color of each point to a file that could then be recompiled in somthing like blender i wasnt abel to crack it in time, but while i was printing the eventual sculpture, i learned that a professer in the sound dept. was able to do almost exactly what i was trying to get to in outputing a file through glsl, that hasn't gone anywhere yet becuase im lazy but thought i'd note that it is possible
